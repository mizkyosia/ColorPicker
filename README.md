# Web Color Picker

Because the default HTML color picker isn't that great
Full HEX, RGB and HSV support. Just a prototype, not really usable right now

TODO :

- HSL support
- Creating the actual ColorPicker Class
- Automatically add the HTML Elements and CSS Stylesheet on script load
- HSL and HSV Values textboxes (like RGB)

Will MAYBE do :

- A more intuitive and classy UI
- Mobile support
